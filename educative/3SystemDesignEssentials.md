# System Design Essentials

## 🚀 Introduction to Modern System Design
Get an overview of the topics we’ll cover in this module.

### 📌 What is system design?
System design is the process of defining components and their integration, APIs, and data models to build **large-scale systems** that meet a specified set of **functional and non-functional requirements**.

System design uses the concepts of:
- **Computer networking**
- **Parallel computing**
- **Distributed systems** to craft systems that **scale well** and are **performant**.

However, distributed systems are inherently complex. The discipline of **system design** helps us **tame this complexity** and get the work done.

### 🔍 Key Goals of System Design
System design aims to build systems that are:
- **Reliable**: Handle faults, failures, and errors.
- **Effective**: Meet all user needs and business requirements.
- **Maintainable**: Flexible and easy to scale up or down. The ability to add new features also comes under maintainability.

## 🏗️ Modern System Design Using Building Blocks
We have separated commonly used design elements, such as **load balancers**, as **basic building blocks** for **high-level system design**. This serves two purposes:
1. **Detailed discussions** on building blocks and their **mini-design challenges**.
2. **Focus on problem-specific aspects**, mentioning the building block we’ll use and **how** we’ll use it.

We have identified **sixteen** critical building blocks in **modern system design**.

## 📚 About This Module
This module focuses on designing systems that:
- **Scale** with increasing users.
- Remain **available** under various fault conditions.
- Meet **functional goals** with **good performance**.

### 🌀 Iterative Process of System Design
Real-world system building is an **iterative process**. We start with a **reasonably good design**, measure **performance**, and improve the design in the **next iteration**.

## 🎯 A Fresh Look at System Design
Many system design courses offer **a formulaic approach**, which might seem attractive for an interview but **fails to instill true understanding**. System design is as much **an art as a science**, and **approaching it from first principles** gives a **fresh perspective**.

## 🌍 Going Deep & Broad
We address both **traditional and novel design problems** touching on aspects such as:
- **Scalability**
- **Availability**
- **Maintainability**
- **Consistency**
- **Fault-tolerance**

### 🔄 Handling Complexity with Assumptions
Real systems are **complex**, and often we must **make appropriate assumptions** to scope a problem effectively.

## 🧠 Interactive Learning Experience
We offer **ample opportunities** for hands-on experience with **system design**:
- **Guided steps** to design systems.
- **End-to-end system design challenges**.
- **Testing concepts through quizzes**.
