# Node Failure Detection

## üîç Node Failure Detection in Distributed Systems

**Node failure detection** is a crucial aspect of building a fault-tolerant distributed key-value store. The system must be able to identify both temporary and permanent node failures to maintain availability, consistency, and durability.

### **1. Membership Management and Gossip Protocol**

- **Membership changes** (nodes joining or leaving) are recorded persistently on each node and synchronized among all ring members using a **gossip protocol**. This protocol ensures an **eventually consistent view of membership**: nodes randomly choose peers to exchange and reconcile membership histories, so all nodes eventually learn about the status of others[6][3].
- The **gossip protocol** is efficient and bandwidth-friendly, allowing asynchronous sharing of state changes without overwhelming the network[6][3].
- **Example:** When node A starts, it adds B and E to its token set and stores this locally. If A processes a change, it gossips this to B and E. Other nodes do the same, ensuring all nodes are eventually up to date[6].

### **2. Temporary Node Failure Detection**

- Each node monitors the health of other nodes in its token set by attempting to communicate with them.
- If a node **fails to communicate** with another node within an authorized time frame, it suspects that node has failed.
- If the communication failure persists, the node notifies administrators that the suspected node is dead[6][4].
- This approach is **decentralized**: every node participates in monitoring, and failure detection is not reliant on a single coordinator[6][4].

### **3. Handling Node Departures**

- Nodes can go offline temporarily or permanently. The system should avoid rebalancing partitions or fixing replicas for every temporary outage, as most are not permanent.
- **Explicit join and leave notifications**: When nodes are added or removed intentionally (planned commissioning/decommissioning), they notify other nodes explicitly, ensuring the ring's membership is accurately updated[6].

### **4. Limitations and Failure Scenarios**

- The **gossip protocol** assumes the network remains connected (i.e., every node can eventually reach every other node, directly or indirectly). If the network is partitioned or there are issues with virtual-to-physical node mappings, some nodes may become isolated, leading to **logical partitioning** and inconsistent membership views[6][3].
- High churn (frequent node joins/leaves) or network issues can cause the gossip protocol to fail to disseminate updates to all nodes, so maintaining a well-connected topology is essential[6][3].

### **Summary Table: Node Failure Detection Approaches**

| Method                         | How It Works                                                                 | Strengths                                | Limitations                                           |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Gossip Protocol                | Nodes exchange membership info randomly and periodically                     | Scalable, bandwidth-efficient            | Needs connected topology; can suffer under high churn |
| Heartbeat/Timeout Monitoring   | Nodes regularly check communication with peers; timeouts indicate suspicion  | Decentralized, responsive                | False positives under network delays                  |
| Explicit Join/Leave Notification| Nodes explicitly notify others when joining or leaving                       | Accurate for planned changes             | Not effective for unplanned failures                  |

**In summary:**  
Node failure detection in distributed key-value stores relies on decentralized protocols like gossip for membership dissemination and heartbeat/timeouts for health checks. These mechanisms, when combined, help maintain system reliability and enable timely recovery from both temporary and permanent node failures[6][3][4].
