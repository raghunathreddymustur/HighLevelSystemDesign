# üõ†Ô∏è Quality Attributes

## üîé Intro
- Quality attributes (QAs) are measurable or testable properties of a software system that indicate how well it meets the needs of stakeholders.
- Architects must choose architectural styles and design elements that align with the desired quality attributes.
- An important point to note about a QA is that the property must be measurable or testable.
- Quality attributes are not only nonfunctional requirements of the system, but also include service-level agreements and other concerns as well.

## üìå Architecturally Significant Quality Attributes

- These QAs may be used to narrow our attention to the essential issues that our design must address. Based on our needs, we may or may not need to take into account every single quality aspect.
- Every application design, for example, must consider security and speed, but not every design must include interoperability. We need to understand our needs so that we can determine which characteristics are critical.

## üåü Important QAs

- **Difficulty Debugging**: Harder to debug problems due to the distributed nature of microservices.

### üìÖ When to Use
Best for large, complex applications requiring high scalability and maintainability. Suitable for applications expected to grow and evolve over time. Not ideal for small or medium-sized systems that don't require highly scalable or complex architecture.

| Non-Functional Requirement | Monolithic | Microservices |
|----------------------------|------------|---------------|
| **Complexity** | Monolithic architecture is generally simpler to understand and implement than microservices architecture, because all of the components of the application are contained in a single codebase. | Microservices architecture, on the other hand, involves breaking the application down into smaller, independent components, or "microservices," which can be more complex to develop and deploy. |
| **Scalability** | Monolithic architecture can be more difficult to scale than microservices architecture because all of the components of the application are tightly coupled and interdependent. This means that changes to one component can affect the others, which can make it difficult to add new features or scale the application without significantly modifying the entire codebase. | In contrast, microservices architecture is designed to be more scalable‚Äîthe independent microservices can be scaled up or down as needed without affecting the rest of the application. |
| **Maintainability** | Monolithic architecture can be more difficult to maintain than microservices architecture, because all of the components of the application are tightly coupled and interdependent. This means that changes to one component can affect the others, which can make it difficult to update or modify the application without significantly modifying the entire codebase. | In contrast, microservices architecture is designed to be more maintainable‚Äîthe independent microservices can be updated or modified without affecting the rest of the application. |
| **Flexibility** | Monolithic architecture can be less flexible than microservices architecture, because it‚Äôs more difficult to reuse or repurpose individual components for other projects. This can limit the flexibility of the application and make it more difficult to adapt to changing requirements or technologies. | In contrast, microservices architecture is designed to be more flexible‚Äîthe independent microservices can be more easily reused or repurposed for other projects. |

## üèóÔ∏è Migrating from Monolithic to Microservices

### üìú Overview
Migrating from monolithic architecture to microservices architecture involves breaking down a large, complex application into smaller, independent components. This process improves scalability, maintainability, and flexibility but requires careful planning and execution.

### üõ†Ô∏è Steps for Migrating

1. **Assess the Current Architecture**: Identify the components and their interconnections in the current architecture.
2. **Identify Microservices**: Divide the application into smaller, self-contained components based on functionality and dependencies.
3. **Design the New Architecture**: Plan how the microservices will communicate with each other.
4. **Implement the New Architecture**: Develop and test the microservices, and set up the necessary infrastructure.
5. **Migrate Data and Functionality**: Move data and functionality from the monolithic architecture to the new microservices architecture.

### üåü Considerations

- **Testing**: Thoroughly test the new architecture to ensure proper functionality and data migration.
- **Cost**: Be aware of the significant redesign and development costs involved.
- **Complexity**: Plan carefully to manage the increased complexity of microservices architecture.
- **Time**: Allocate sufficient time for the migration process, especially for large and complex applications.


## üèóÔ∏è Micro-Frontends

### üìú Overview
Micro-frontends architecture divides the frontend of a website or application into smaller, independent components, or "micro-frontends," that can be created and deployed individually. This approach is similar to microservices architecture but applied to the frontend.

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale as changes to one micro-frontend don‚Äôt affect others.
- **Maintainability**: Independent updates and modifications without affecting the rest of the application.
- **Flexibility**: Reuse or repurpose individual micro-frontends for other projects.
- **Ease of Testing**: Easier to test individual micro-frontends than the entire frontend.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: More complex to develop and deploy due to the need for coordination and communication between micro-frontends.
- **Increased Overhead**: More overhead in coordinating and communicating between micro-frontends.
- **Difficulty Debugging**: Harder to debug problems due to interactions between multiple micro-frontends.

### üîÑ Comparison: Micro-Frontends vs. Microservices

| Non-Functional Requirement | Micro-Frontends | Microservices |
|----------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Focus** | Breaking down a monolithic frontend into smaller, loosely coupled components. | Breaking down a monolithic backend into smaller, loosely coupled services. |
| **Scalability** | Improves the scalability and maintainability of the frontend. | Improves the scalability and maintainability of the backend. |
| **Performance** | Can lead to better performance and faster deployment cycles. | Can lead to better performance and faster deployment cycles. |
| **Independence** | Each component can be developed and deployed independently. | Each service can be developed and deployed independently. |
| **Communication** | Typically communicates with APIs to access shared data and services. | Typically communicates using lightweight, standardized protocols such as REST or gRPC. |
| **Complexity** | Can result in a more complex front-end architecture with more inter-component communication. | Can result in a more complex back-end architecture with more inter-service communication. |

### üìÖ When to Use
Micro-frontend design is best suited for large, sophisticated applications that demand high front-end scalability and maintainability. It might not be the best option for small or medium-sized applications that don‚Äôt require highly scalable or complex front-end architecture.
