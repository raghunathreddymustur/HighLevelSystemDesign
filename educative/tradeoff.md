# Trade-Offs

## CAP

### üìú The CAP Theorem
The CAP theorem outlines an inherent trade-off in the design of distributed systems.

### üìú Initial statement of the CAP theorem
It is impossible for a distributed data store to provide more than two of the following properties simultaneously: **consistency**, **availability**, and **partition tolerance**.

### üìú Partition Tolerance
In a distributed system, there is always the risk of a network partition. If this happens, the system needs to decide either to continue operating and compromise **data consistency**, or stop operating and compromise **availability**.

### üìú Final statement of the CAP theorem
A distributed system can be either **consistent** or **available** in the presence of a network partition.

### üìú Proof
The system has two options during a network partition: fail one of the operations and break the **availability** property, or process both operations and break the **consistency** property.

### üìú Importance of the CAP theorem
The CAP theorem forces designers of distributed systems to make explicit trade-offs between **availability** and **consistency**.

### üìú Categorization of distributed systems based on the CAP theorem
Systems are usually classified into two basic categories: **CP** (Consistency and Partition tolerance) and **AP** (Availability and Partition tolerance). This classification depends on which property the system violates during a network partition.

### üìú Trade-off between latency and consistency
When no network partition is present, there‚Äôs a trade-off between **latency** and **consistency**. To guarantee data consistency, the system will have to delay write operations until the data has been propagated across the system successfully, thus taking a latency hit.

## PACELC theorem

### üìú PACELC theorem
The PACELC theorem states that in the case of a network partition (P), the system has to choose between **availability** (A) and **consistency** (C), but else (E), when the system operates normally, it has to choose between **latency** (L) and **consistency** (C).

### üìú Categorization of distributed systems based on PACELC theorem
Each branch of the PACELC theorem creates two sub-categories of systems: **AP/EL** (Availability during partition, Latency during normal operation) and **CP/EC** (Consistency during partition, Consistency during normal operation). Most systems fall into the AP/EL or CP/EC categories.

Here are some **trade-offs** mentioned in the current page regarding **distributed messaging queues**:

### **‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs in Distributed Messaging Queues**
1. **Strict Ordering vs. Throughput**
    - Ensuring **strict message order** requires additional mechanisms like **timestamp-based sorting** and **serialization**.
    - These techniques **introduce processing delays**, reducing the system‚Äôs ability to handle large volumes of messages efficiently.
    - Some systems **sacrifice strict ordering** to achieve **higher throughput**, allowing messages to be processed in parallel.

2. **Latency vs. Message Ordering**
    - **Online sorting** ensures messages are processed in the correct sequence but **introduces delays** before messages are ready for extraction.
    - To **reduce latency**, some systems use a **time-window approach**, where messages are **batched and sorted together** instead of sorting each message individually.

3. **Scalability vs. Reliability**
    - A **single-server messaging queue** has **low scalability** but **high reliability** since all messages are processed in one place.
    - A **distributed messaging queue** improves **scalability** but requires **replication and synchronization**, which can introduce **consistency challenges**.

4. **Decoupling vs. Complexity**
    - Messaging queues **decouple dependencies** among different entities, making systems more flexible.

The current page on rate limiters does not explicitly mention tradeoffs, but we can infer some potential ones based on the discussion.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Tradeoffs in Rate Limiter Design

#### **‚úÖ Reliability vs. ‚ùå Performance**
Rate limiters enhance **service reliability** by preventing excessive load and ensuring fair resource allocation. However, enforcing limits can introduce **latency** since every request needs to be verified before processing.

#### **‚úÖ Security vs. ‚ùå Usability**
Rate limiters **protect services** against **brute-force attacks** and **denial-of-service incidents**, but aggressive throttling can frustrate **legitimate users** if they frequently hit usage limits.

#### **‚úÖ Cost Control vs. ‚ùå User Experience**
Organizations use rate limiters to **reduce excessive operational costs** (such as API overuse), but **strict rate limits** can degrade the experience for users relying on high-throughput interactions.

#### **‚úÖ Distributed Load vs. ‚ùå Complexity**
Rate limiters **help distribute data processing loads** across multiple machines, preventing overburdening a single node. However, in **distributed systems**, implementing **global rate limiting** requires coordination, which adds complexity.

Here are the tradeoffs mentioned in the current page regarding rate limiter design:

### ‚öñÔ∏è Tradeoffs in Rate Limiter Design

#### **‚úÖ Centralized Database vs. ‚ùå Latency & Race Conditions**
A **centralized database** ensures that all rate limiters share a **single source of truth**, preventing clients from exceeding limits. However, this approach can introduce **latency issues** when handling a large number of requests and may lead to **race conditions** in highly concurrent environments.

#### **‚úÖ Distributed Database vs. ‚ùå Temporary Limit Violations**
