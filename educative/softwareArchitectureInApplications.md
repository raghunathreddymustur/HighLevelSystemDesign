# üõ†Ô∏è Quality Attributes

## üîé Intro
- Quality attributes (QAs) are measurable or testable properties of a software system that indicate how well it meets the needs of stakeholders.
- Architects must choose architectural styles and design elements that align with the desired quality attributes.
- An important point to note about a QA is that the property must be measurable or testable.
- Quality attributes are not only nonfunctional requirements of the system, but also include service-level agreements and other concerns as well.

## üìå Architecturally Significant Quality Attributes

- These QAs may be used to narrow our attention to the essential issues that our design must address. Based on our needs, we may or may not need to take into account every single quality aspect.
- Every application design, for example, must consider security and speed, but not every design must include interoperability. We need to understand our needs so that we can determine which characteristics are critical.

## üåü Important QAs

## Architecture Patterns

## üèõÔ∏è Centralized and Decentralized Architecture

### üìú Overview
Centralized and decentralized architectures represent two fundamental ways of organizing systems. They define how entities function, make choices, distribute resources, and manage tasks.

### üñ•Ô∏è Centralized Architecture
Centralized architecture involves a server node (controller) managing client nodes (workers). The server node distributes work, and client nodes perform the tasks.

#### Characteristics
- **Global clock**: Client nodes sync their clocks with the server node.
- **Single server node**: One server node serves all client nodes, and its failure affects the whole system.

#### Advantages
- **Ease of security**: Easy to secure server and client nodes.
- **Quick updates**: Updates are made only to the central server, ensuring efficiency.

#### Disadvantages
- **Network connectivity**: If the server disconnects, the whole network slows down.
- **Data backup**: All data is stored in the server node, risking data loss if it fails.

### üåê Decentralized Architecture
Decentralized architecture allows each node to make its own decisions, with no single controller node. Examples include cryptocurrency and blockchain systems.

#### Characteristics
- **System resilience**: Failure of one node doesn't affect the whole system.
- **Multiple servers**: More than one server can handle requests, improving efficiency.

#### Disadvantages
- **Node failure**: Individual node failures can disrupt the system.
- **Security risks**: Vulnerable to attacks on individual nodes.

#### Advantages
- **Avoid bottlenecks**: Load is distributed among nodes, preventing bottlenecks.
- **High availability**: Nodes make independent decisions, ensuring some are always available.

# Software Architecture Patterns with Realtime Examples

## üèóÔ∏è Layered Architecture

### üìú Overview
Layered architecture divides a system into units or layers, allowing independent development and clear documentation. Each layer provides a consistent set of services and can only access its next lower neighbor.

### üîÑ Open vs. Closed Layers
- **Closed Layers**: Requests must go through each layer without bypassing, ensuring separation and easier modifications.
- **Open Layers**: Layers can be bypassed, increasing complexity but reducing traffic on individual levels.

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Simplifies Structure**: Divides the application into distinct layers, reducing complexity.
- **Decreases Dependencies**: Allows easier substitution of different implementations for a particular layer.
- **Improves Testability**: Isolates layers for testing, increasing reusability and scalability.
- **Enhances Security**: Separate tiers improve security with firewalls between layers.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- **Interdependence**: Changes in one layer can require changes in multiple layers, reducing flexibility.
- **Increased Code**: Requires more code for communication between layers, risking logic leaks.
- **Inefficiencies**: Requests through multiple layers can be inefficient, and deploying multiple layers increases costs.

### üîß Realtime Example: E-commerce Application
- **Presentation Layer**: A web or mobile interface showing product catalogs, search functionality, and shopping cart.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Processes product recommendations, applies discounts, and calculates taxes.
- **Data Access Layer**: Handles interactions with databases to fetch product information, order details, and user profiles.
- **Example Flow**: A customer searches for a product -> The request goes to the business layer for processing -> Fetches product details from the data access layer -> Returns to the presentation layer to display results.

## üèõÔ∏è N-Tier Architecture

### üìú Overview
N-tier architecture organizes system components into distinct layers or tiers. Tiers can be based on functionality or computing environment, defining control and communication patterns or allocation patterns.

### üñ•Ô∏è Tiers vs. Layers
- **Layers**: Logical separation of functionality and components.
- **Tiers**: Physical separation of different components of the software system.

### üé® Presentation Tier
The presentation tier handles the application's user interface. It focuses on usability and should have minimal logic to simplify testing.

### üè¢ Business Tier
The business tier implements the application's business logic, including rules, validations, and calculations. It acts as a bridge between the presentation and data tiers.

### üìä Data Tier
The data tier provides data access and management functions. It includes a data store for persistent storage and interacts with the business tier.

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Secure**: Easy to secure each tier.
- **Flexible**: Extendable in multiple ways.
- **Scalable**: Scale or update any tier independently.
- **Improved Modularity**: Separate development and maintenance of components.
- **Better Scalability**: Independent scaling of tiers.
- **Increased Security**: Separation of presentation and data layers.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Easier updates without affecting other tiers.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- **Costly**: High hardware, network, and deployment costs.
- **Complexity**: More complex implementation.
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional layers can lead to performance overhead.
- **Increased Development Time**: Longer development due to multiple tiers.

### üîß Realtime Example: Banking System
- **Presentation Tier**: A web or mobile banking app interface for customers to check their balance, transfer funds, or view transaction history.
- **Business Tier**: Processes business rules like validating account details, calculating interest rates, and handling transaction rules.
- **Data Tier**: Stores customer accounts, transaction details, and balance history.
- **Example Flow**: A user initiates a money transfer -> Business tier validates user credentials and account details -> Data tier records the transaction -> Business tier notifies the presentation tier to display a success message.

## üèõÔ∏è Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture

### üìú Overview
MVC is a software architecture pattern that divides an application into three components: Model, View, and Controller. This separation provides a structured and organized way to design and develop applications.

### üóÇÔ∏è Model
The model represents the business logic and data of the application. It maintains the state and performs operations on the data.

### üñºÔ∏è View
The view is responsible for rendering the user interface. It receives data from the model and presents it to the user.

### üéÆ Controller
The controller handles user input and interactions. It processes requests from the view and sends them to the model, then updates the view with the results.

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific role, keeping the code organized.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other applications.
- **Testability**: Easier to write automated tests for different components.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for different views and controllers for the same model.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: Can make the application more complex for new developers.
- **Increased Overhead**: Requires more code and components.
- **Extra Layer of Abstraction**: Adds an extra layer between the user and model, which can make the application less intuitive.

### üîß Realtime Example: Blog Management System
- **Model**: Manages blog data, such as posts, authors, and comments.
- **View**: Displays the blog interface, showing posts and comments.
- **Controller**: Handles user actions like creating, editing, or deleting posts.
- **Example Flow**: A user edits a blog post -> Controller updates the model -> Model saves the updated data -> View refreshes to display the updated post.

## üèõÔ∏è Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Architecture

### üìú Overview
MVVM separates the presentation layer from business logic and data models, enhancing flexibility and maintenance. It consists of three main components: Model, View, and ViewModel.

### üóÇÔ∏è Model
The model represents the data and business logic of the application. It manages data and performs actions on it.

### üñºÔ∏è View
The view represents the user interface, displaying data to the user and processing user input.

### üéÆ ViewModel
The view model links the model and the view, presenting data from the model to the view and managing UI logic and events.

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between the view and model, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Improved Testability**: Easier to write automated tests for different components.
- **Better Support for Data Binding**: Built-in support for data binding, creating interactive applications.
- **Improved Code Reuse**: Easier to reuse code across different views and platforms.

### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- **Increased Complexity**: Can make the application more complex, especially for new developers.
- **More Code**: Requires more code, increasing development time and resources.
- **Steep Learning Curve**: Challenging to master, particularly for those unfamiliar with WPF or other XAML-based platforms.

### üîß Realtime Example: Weather Forecast Application
- **Model**: Retrieves weather data from APIs.
- **ViewModel**: Processes raw weather data (e.g., converting temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius) and binds it to the view.
- **View**: Displays the processed weather data to the user.
- **Example Flow**: User opens the app -> ViewModel fetches and processes weather data from the model -> View updates to show the current temperature and weather forecast.
