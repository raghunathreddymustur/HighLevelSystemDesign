# üõ†Ô∏è Quality Attributes

## üîé Intro
- Quality attributes (QAs) are measurable or testable properties of a software system that indicate how well it meets the needs of stakeholders.
- Architects must choose architectural styles and design elements that align with the desired quality attributes.
- An important point to note about a QA is that the property must be measurable or testable.
- Quality attributes are not only nonfunctional requirements of the system, but also include service-level agreements and other concerns as well.

## üìå Architecturally Significant Quality Attributes

- These QAs may be used to narrow our attention to the essential issues that our design must address. Based on our needs, we may or may not need to take into account every single quality aspect.
- Every application design, for example, must consider security and speed, but not every design must include interoperability. We need to understand our needs so that we can determine which characteristics are critical.

## üåü Important QAs

| QA            | Description                                                                 | How to Test It                                                                                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Availability  | Defined as the proportion of time that the system is up and working         | Can be measured as a percentage of total system downtime over a predefined time period               |
| Maintainability | Defined as the ability to undergo changes as required                      | Can be measured by calculating the time it takes to undergo the changes as required                  |
| Performance   | An indication of the responsiveness of a system to execute our commands within a given interval of time | Can be measured in terms of latency or throughput                                                    |
| Reliability   | Defined as the chances that a product will perform its intended behaviour under the defined circumstances | Can be measured in terms of the correlation between two scores of test-retests                       |
| Reusability   | If we can use the product, or some specific part of the product, in the production of any other product | Can be tested by evaluating the software system‚Äôs functionality in different scenarios, testing modularity and compatibility, and assessing the performance and integration abilities |
| Security      | Measures taken to protect the system and its resources from unauthorized access and attacks | Can be tested via penetration testing, security code reviews, security testing tools, security assessments, user acceptance testing, and production monitoring |
| Scalability   | Defined as a scale of the system‚Äôs increasing or decreasing capability      | Can be measured in terms of its capacity to extend or reduce the quantity of user requests           |
| Load Balancing| Defined as a technique used to distribute workloads evenly across multiple computing resources to optimize resource utilization, increase reliability, and improve scalability | Can be measured by evaluating the distribution of incoming requests among the servers, response time, resource utilization, and the reliability of the system |
| Caching       | The temporary storage of frequently accessed data in a fast-access memory to reduce the number of expensive I/O operations, speed up access to the data, and reduce response time | Can be measured by evaluating the hit rate (ratio of cache hits to total requests), response time, and reduction of I/O operations |

# üìã Requirements and Constraints

- Requirements are what actually drive the architecture.
- Constraints are design decisions on which no compromise can be made.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Conflicting Constraints in Ride-Sharing App Design

### 1. ‚ö° Real-time Responsiveness
- **Requirement:** Users expect real-time updates on driver location, estimated arrival times, and immediate booking.
- **Demand:** Low-latency communication and quick processing are essential.

### 2. üîí Data Security
- **Requirement:** Protect user data, including personal and payment information.
- **Measures:** Strong security measures like encryption, secure authentication, and rigorous access controls.

### Conflict
- **Issue:** Implementing strong security measures can introduce latency.
- **Challenge:** Prioritizing real-time responsiveness might lead to security vulnerabilities.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Balancing Act
- **Trade-offs:** Improving real-time responsiveness may compromise data security; focusing on security could slow down real-time aspects.
- **Solution:** Software architects and designers need to find an acceptable compromise between these conflicting constraints.

# üèóÔ∏è Application Types

- Represent different fundamental approaches or paradigms for designing and structuring software applications and help in providing a high-level understanding of how an application is built.
- Choosing an appropriate app type depends on specific requirements and infrastructure limitations.
